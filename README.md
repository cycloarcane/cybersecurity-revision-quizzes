# Cybersecurity Revision Quizzes

This repository contains a set of **interactive cybersecurity revision quizzes** designed to support self‑study, exam preparation, and general knowledge reinforcement.

The project features both a **local web-based version** and a **hardened Android application**, providing a secure and flexible environment for learners.

## 📱 Android Application

The repository includes a complete Android Studio project (`/AndroidApp`) that compiles into a hardened, zero-permission mobile application.

### Security Architecture
The Android app is built with a focus on security and privacy:
- **Zero Permissions**: The app requests no Android permissions (no network, no file access, no location).
- **WebView Hardening**: Uses `WebViewAssetLoader` to serve local content via virtual HTTPS (`https://appassets.androidplatform.net/assets/`), preventing common `file://` scheme vulnerabilities.
- **Strict Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: A robust CSP blocks all inline scripts and styles, mitigating potential XSS risks.
- **Data Isolation**: Quiz datasets are isolated into standalone JS modules, ensuring a clean separation between the logic engine and content.
- **R8 Obfuscation**: Release builds are automatically obfuscated and shrunk to protect source code and minimize the attack surface.

### Build Instructions
Refer to the [Android Build & Security Guide](AndroidApp/BUILD_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on compiling, signing, and verifying the APK.

## 🌐 Web Version (Hardened)

The quizzes are also available as a hardened web application for use in desktop browsers. This version uses the exact same secure architecture as the Android app.

### Features
- **CSP Compliant**: Full protection against inline script execution.
- **Unified Engine**: Shared logic between web and mobile platforms.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both large screens and mobile browsers.

### How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cycloarcane/cybersecurity-revision-quizzes.git
   ```
2. **Open locally**
   Navigate to the directory and open `index.html` in your browser.

> **Note**
> While the web version is hardened with a strict Content-Security-Policy, it is still recommended for local use. If deploying to a web server, ensure you configure appropriate server-side security headers.
